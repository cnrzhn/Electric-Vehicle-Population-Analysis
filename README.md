### Project Overview

This project involves the analysis of the "Electric Vehicle Population" dataset, which provides comprehensive data on electric vehicles, including details like make, model, electric range, and more. The dataset is sourced from [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data).

### Key Objectives

- Explore and understand the characteristics of electric vehicles.
- Analyze the distribution and adoption patterns of electric vehicles in the given region.
- Apply machine learning models to predict various aspects of electric vehicles based on the dataset.

### Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**: The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed, including renaming columns and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Conducted initial analysis to understand the dataset's structure and contents.
3. **Machine Learning**: Implemented classification models like Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. Hyperparameter tuning was done using GridSearchCV.
4. **Evaluation and Insights**: Models were evaluated based on accuracy, and cross-validation was performed. The insights obtained were used to understand the electric vehicle market better.

### Results

The project provided valuable insights into the electric vehicle market, highlighting the distribution and features of electric vehicles. The machine learning models offered predictions about various aspects, contributing to the growing knowledge in this domain.
